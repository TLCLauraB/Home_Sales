Module 22 Challenge: Home Sales Using SparkSQL<br/>
Very Last Homework of the Class!<br/>
Presented by Laura Bishop (TLCLauraB)<br/>
<br/>

## Introduction: 

In this challenge, I will use my knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then I will use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

## Workflow:

There was no ETL for this assignment, everything was provided through the starter code. I renamed the file 'Home_Sales' from 'Home_Sales_starter_code_colab' as per the module instructions.
